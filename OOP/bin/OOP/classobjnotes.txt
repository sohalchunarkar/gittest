In Java, classes and objects form the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They help model real-world entities and organize code in a structured way.

A class is a blueprint used to create objects that share common properties and behavior.
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity created from the class template.
Java Class
A class is a blueprint that defines data and behavior for objects. It groups related fields and methods in a single unit. Memory for its members is allocated only when an object is created.

Acts as a template to create objects with shared structure.
Does not occupy memory for fields until instantiation.
Can contain fields, methods, constructors, nested classes and interfaces.

Java Objects
An object is an instance of a class created to access its data and operations. Each object holds its own state.

State: Values stored in fields.
Behavior: Actions defined through methods.
Identity: Distinguishes one object from another.
Objects mirror real-world items such as customer, product or circle. Non-primitive objects are stored on the heap while their references remain on the stack.

Object Instantiation
Creating an object is known as instantiation. All instances of a class share structure and behavior while storing different state values.

Java Constructors
Last Updated : 13 Nov, 2025
A constructor in Java is a special member that is called when an object is created. It initializes the new object’s state. It is used to set default or user-defined values for the object's attributes

A constructor has the same name as the class.
It does not have a return type, not even void.
It can accept parameters to initialize object properties.
Types of Constructors in Java
There are four types of constructors in Java
1. Default Constructor
A default constructor has no parameters. It’s used to assign default values to an object. If no constructor is explicitly defined, Java provides a default constructor.

2. Parameterized Constructor
A constructor that has parameters is known as parameterized constructor. If we want to initialize fields of the class with our own values, then use a parameterized constructor.

3. Copy Constructor in Java
Unlike other constructors copy constructor is passed with another object which copies the data available from the passed object to the newly created object.


4. Private Constructor
A private constructor cannot be accessed from outside the class. It is commonly used in:

Singleton Pattern: To ensure only one instance of a class is created.
Utility/Helper Classes: To prevent instantiation of a class containing only static methods.
